# Welcome

Welcome to Arivara

This game is in very early stages of construction as a hobby project, however
the intent is that you are able to enjoy the journey.

The current [getting started guide](getting_started.md) can help in getting
started with participating in the community and the  part of the first cohort
of people to have access to game release milestones.

## Contributions

Contributions are greatly welcomed and encouraged, so if you find anything that
is in the game but not in these articles, please feel free to contribute with
a pull request using Github Pull Requests.

If you are new to Markdown, [this guide](https://commonmark.org/help/) by
CommonMark is a great resource to help you get started.
