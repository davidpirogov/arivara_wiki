# Getting Started

Getting started with Arivara is a staged approach based on the specific
release milestone and select number of users.

| Milestone         | Status    | Milestone goals               |
|:-----------------:|:---------:|:------------------------------|
| **Release 0.1**   | Current   | Infrastructure and resiliency |
| **Release 0.2**   | Scheduled | Hosting and availability      |
| **Release 0.3**   | Planning  | Account management and support|
| **Release 0.4**   | Planning  | Game systems and rule sets    |
| **Release 0.5**   | Planning  | Universe Alpha                |
| **Release 0.6**   | Planning  | 4X Alpha                      |



## Future plans

The plan is for a simple and easy way to get started with a self-service
portal and account management interface, currently scheduled for *Release 0.3*
for select people and *Release 0.6* for general public beta.

The subsequent releases are currently *unplanned* but may look something like:

 * Release 0.7 to 0.9 - Content and gameplay
 * Release 1.0 - Transition into season content release cadence in the form of
   YYMM versioning, where YY is short year and MM is month of year.
